      <h2>What we're about</h2>
      <p>It started with some real frustrations at work. Something felt wrong &mdash; misaligned &mdash; and we started having conversations about what we wanted to be doing, what would make work meaningful. Those amazing conversations resulted in some real stuff that changed how we live our work/life.</p>

      <p>Our name, maitria, comes from the sanskrit word <em>maitri</em> (pronounced like “my tree”), meaning unconditional friendliness, loving-kindness, connection. The name <em>Maitreya</em> comes from this same root. We use words like these to remember the mindfulness that we want to bring to our work.</p>
