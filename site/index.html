        <h3>What We're About</h3>
        <p>Because we care about beautiful code, we hack with intention. Because we care about geek joy, we encourage geeks to code from the heart. Because we care about what's alive in the people we touch, we listen and speak with courageous curiousity. Because we care about what emerges when we collaborate, we show up with confident humility.</p>
